# Just Another Text Editor (J.A.T.E)

## Description

J.A.T.E is a text editor web application that runs in the browser. It's a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria and features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.

AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
